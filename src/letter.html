          <h2>My Beloved Kayla,</h2>
          <p>Happy Anniversary!</p>
          <p>
            Time flies so fast—I can't believe today marks our one-year
            anniversary. As I sit here writing this, my heart is overflowing
            with love and gratitude for you. Every day with you is a blessing,
            and I'm constantly amazed by your kindness, your strength, and your
            beautiful heart.
          </p>
          <p>
            Being apart makes this even harder. I miss your hugs and kisses, the
            warmth of your presence beside me, the way we'd sit together in your
            living room, laughing and cuddling. I miss you.
          </p>
          <p>
            I still remember the first time we met—how nervous I was, how you
            smiled, and how time seemed to stand still. From that moment, I knew
            there was something special about you, something that drew me in and
            made me want to know everything about you.
          </p>
          <p>
            This past year, you've pushed me beyond what I ever thought I was
            capable of. You've made me smarter, stronger, and better in ways I
            never imagined. I truly couldn't have done this without you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thank you for choosing me, for walking this path with me, and for
            building a love that is more beautiful than I could have ever
            imagined. You are my happiness, my motivation, and the reason I wake
            up every day striving for a better future.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here's to another year of love, laughter, and adventure together. I
            will love you forever and ever, my princess.
          </p>
          <p class="signature">Forever yours,<br />Adlan</p>
